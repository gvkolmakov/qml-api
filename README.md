**1. Quick start for ML API**
   
Thank you for your interest in machine learning (ML) API.

Your image recongition ML API code is in client_app.py file.  With just a few lines of code, the app: 
<ol>
<li> uploads your training set to the server, </li>

<li> trains an ML model on the server, and </li>

<li> returns labels for your files that you send to the server.</li>
</ol>

How to run - quick start: 

<ol>
<li>  Download the files from github to your local computer </li>

<li> Go to the directory my_datasets/MNIST_1024_imgs and unzip the sample training data file MNIST_1024_images.zip </li>

<li> To run as a stand-alone application, from the directory where you downloaded the files, run in the command line in a terminal:

```python
python3 client_app.py
```
</li>

<li> Alternatively, use the calls from client_app.py in your python application code. </li>

For the best result;) keep ngq.py file in the same directory where your code (f.e. client_app.py) is.

**2. Creating a labeled set with a complimentary online tool.**
   
If you need to label your files to create the training set for your application, use our complimentary free online labeling tool at:

**3. Contact us.**
   
Feel free to contact me and my team at: german@ngq.io with any question.
If you need to tune the app and server functionality to your needs, email me to the address above and request your API key for personalized server settings.

**5. Tribute.**
   
The development of this technology is supported by the National Science Foundation, Partnership For Innovation program, award NSF TIP #2141058, see the details at: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2141058&HistoricalAwards=false 

Will be happy to get your feedback.
