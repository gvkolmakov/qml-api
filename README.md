**1. Quick start for ML API**
   
Thank you for your interest in machine learning (ML) API.

Your image recongition ML API code is in client_app.py file.  It 

(1) uploads your training set to the server, 

(2) trains an ML model on the server, and 

(3) returns labels for your files that you send to the server.

How to run: 

(a) Use the calls from client_app.py in your python application code.

(b) To run as a stand-alone application, try in the command line in a terminal:

$  python3 client_app.py

For the best result;) place ngq.py file in the same directory where your code (f.e. client_app.py) is.

**2. Creating a labeled set with a cmplimentary online tool.**
   
If you need to label your files to create the training set for your application, use our complimentary free online labeling tool at:

**3. Contact us.**
   
Feel free to contact me and my team at: german@ngq.io with any question.
If you need to tune the app and server functionality to your needs, email me to the address above and request your API key for personalized server settings.

**5. Tribute.**
   
The development of this technology is supported by the National Science Foundation, Partnership For Innovation program, award NSF TIP #2141058, see the details at: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2141058&HistoricalAwards=false 

Will be happy to get your feedback.

Thank you!
